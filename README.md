## Description:

This version can only calculate the PSNR of images by using the proposed CNN-based predictor (CNNP) with expansion embedding and histogram shifting. The working environment is Windows 10, Python 3.7, and MATLAB 2019a. The work is based on the paper:

   R. Hu and S. Xiang, "CNN Prediction Based Reversible Data Hiding," in IEEE Signal Processing Letters, doi: 10.1109/LSP.2021.3059202.



## Folder description :

"standard_test_images":  This folder contains four standard images used in this paper. Other images come from ImageNet.

"model":                          This folder contains the proposed CNN-based predictor.

"model_parameter":         This folder contains the parameter of the proposed CNN-based predictor.


## Usage:

python main.py [size] [model] [folder] [length] 

size:                 The size of the images, which is set to 512*512 in this letter.
model:             The saved model parameters.
folder:              The place of the image to be predicted.
length:             The length of the data to be hidden.


After using this program, the PSNR of the watermarked image by using the proposed CNNP-based reversible data hiding method will appear.

## Example:

### (1)For histogram shifting:

python main.py -size 512 512 -model '.\model_parameter\model_state.pth' -folder '.\standard_test_images' -mode 'histogram shifting' -length 10000


### (2)For expansion embedding:

python main.py -size 512 512 -model '.\model_parameter\model_state.pth' -folder '.\standard_test_images' -mode 'expansion embedding' -length 10000
